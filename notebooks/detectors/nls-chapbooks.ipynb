    "# Early Printed Book Illustration Detection Using Object Detectors\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we describe the process to create a book illustration detector that can automatically detect illustration in images containing early printed book pages. Such an illustration detector has enabled the [visual analysis of chapbooks printed in Scotland](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/chapbooks/). The book illustration detector presented in this tutorial is trained using the [chapbooks dataset](https://data.nls.uk/data/digitised-collections/chapbooks-printed-in-scotland/) published in the public domain by the National Library of Scotland (NLS).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is organised as follows. First, we download and install all the required tools in this interactive python notebook. Next, we demonstrate an existing (i.e. pre-trained) illustration detector taken from the [VGG Chapbooks](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/chapbooks/) project. The process of creating such an automatic illustration detector is described next. Finally, we describe some advanced, but optional, learning exercise which demonstrated the impact of training sample on performance of automatic illustration detectors.\n"

    "## 3. Creating an Automatic Book Illustration Detector?\n",
    "In this section, we describe the process of creating an automatic book illustration detector which involves creating manually annotated examples of the object (i.e. book illustration) and a training process in which an object detector learns to identify these objects in an image using the manually annotated samples. The training process is fully automatic. Therefore, the only laborious part of this process is the manual annotation of object instances. To reduce the workload, we have provided samples of manual annotations and learners are required to only manually annotate 5 images. The process is described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Create Manually Annotated Dataset\n",
    "To train an object detector, we need examples of how the object appears in an image. Since we are creating a book illustration detector, we collect some images of book pages containing an illustration and manually annotate (i.e. draw a rectangular box) the location of these illustrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we have prepared a set of 25 images that contains an illustration and are taken from the NLS Chapbooks Dataset. Here are the steps to view and create the required manual annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the [nls-chapbooks-25.zip (9MB)](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/chapbooks/dh2022/data/nls-chapbooks-25.zip) file which contains the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 25 images from Chapbooks for training in `img/` folder\n",
    "  * Manual annotations of **only 20 training images** in `train.json` file (remaining 5 manual annotations should to be done by the learner)\n",
    "  * 50 images from Chapbooks for testing in `img/` folder\n",
    "  * Manual annotations of all 50 test images in `test.json` file\n",
    "  * List Annotator (LISA) application `lisa.html` to create new manual annotations and view existing annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open `lisa.html` file in a web browser (e.g. Firefox, Chrome, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Click \"Browse\" (or Choose File) in the \"Load Existing Project\" section and select the training annotations contained in the `train.json` LISA project.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Draw a rectangular bounding box around illustration of 5 Chapbook images that are missing manual annotation. To draw a bounding box around an illustration, press mouse button and drag mouse cursor over the illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After all the manual annotations are created, press `Ctrl` + `S` (i.e. hold Control key and press the `S` key) to save the annotations as `train25.json` in the same folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You may be curious about how we created the `nls-chapbooks-25` dataset for this exercise. The dataset contained in `nls-chapbooks-25` was created using the [split-manual-annotations-for-exercises.py](https://gitlab.com/vgg/nls-chapbooks-illustrations/-/blob/master/tools/split-manual-annotations-for-exercises.py) as follows\n",

    "Deep learning models often face a challenge when they have to operate on test data that are different from the training data. Since we trained on 25 images taken from the NLS Chapbooks dataset, the [following image](https://gitlab.com/vgg/nls-chapbooks-illustrations/-/blob/master/data/images/test_images/BL_tyndales-new-testament-1526-c_188_a_17_f001r.jpg) taken from the [British Library](https://www.bl.uk/sacred-texts/articles/from-sacred-scriptures-to-the-peoples-bible) is a challenging test image for this model. Learners are encouraged to apply this illustration detector on the challenging image which may disheartened some of the learners. Here are some notes to help the learners think through this new observation.\n",
